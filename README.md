# Hero Finder
## The Iron Yard Final Project
---
## Synopsis
<p>
This app allows fans of Marvel Comics to search a 70-year archive of comics and
characters. Collectors can also use this app to add comics to their collections
or wish-lists.
</p>
<p>
Hero Finder is my final Project for the Iron Yard. This was programmed over three
weeks as the capstone project for the course.
</p>

## Code Information
<p>
This project primarily uses React.js, Backbone and Bootstrap. There is a dash of
jQuery sprinkled in the project.
</p>
---
## Known Issues
<p>
The currently deployed version does not make calls to Marvel's API, which breaks
the functionality of much of the app.
</p>
<p>
To protect my Marvel API keys, I used a proxy server. I ran both the project and
the server locally to demo the project.
</p>
<p>
Contact me if you are interested in getting a better demo of the project.
